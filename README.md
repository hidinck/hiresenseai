HireSense AI — Smart Resume Screening

HireSense AI is a full-stack web app I built to simplify the hiring process.
It helps recruiters upload resumes and job descriptions, automatically analyze skills using AI, match candidates, and rank them — all from a clean dashboard.
The goal was to reduce manual shortlisting and make hiring faster, fairer, and more data-driven.

What It Does
Lets users sign up and log in securely
Upload multiple resumes and a job description
Uses AI to extract and compare skill
Shows match percentages and explanations
Ranks candidates from best to least fit
Works smoothly on desktop and mobile

Built With
Frontend: React, CSS, Vite
Backend: FastAPI (Python)
Auth: JWT Tokens
Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL
Deployment: Netlify + Railway / Render

How It Works
Upload resumes → Upload JD → AI analyzes → Matching → Ranking → Results
